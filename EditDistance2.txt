Running time and space requirement of implemented algorithm:

Running time and space requirement are: Ɵ(mn) 
Where m is length of first string and n is length of second string.

Solution to part b:
The DNA-alignment problem is just the edit-distance problem, with  
cost(copy) =− 1, 
cost(replace) =+ 1,
 cost(delete) =+ 2,
 cost(insert) =+ 2,
the twiddle and kill operations are not permitted. 
The score that we are trying to maximize in the DNA-alignment problem is precisely the negative of the cost we are trying to minimize in the edit-distance problem. The negative cost of copy is not an impediment, since we can only apply the copy operation when the characters are equal.
